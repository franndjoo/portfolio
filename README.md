# Portfolio

My portfolio is the first project I ever published in GitHub, it's in fact quite
old and it has gone by a lot of different versions.

This version is coded in Javascript, HTML, CSS and with a pseudo-language 
intrepreted using the `moviemaker` engine. Making such an engine has been 
decided to reduce the overhead caused by repetitive JS syntax elements and 
make parallax feel like magic.
