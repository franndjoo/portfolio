            <p class="paraph">
                I'm currently a Computer Science student at EPITECH. I'm keen on 
                this since 2016 and I didn't spent more than two consecutive 
                days without coding since. But my personality isn't limited to 
                computer science, in fact, computer science is one of the ways 
                I found to express my artistic sense.
